# 📘 Next.js LMS & CMS Course Builder

This is a personal project built using **Next.js** that serves as a Learning Management System (LMS) and Content Management System (CMS). It is designed to showcase my skills in **Next.js**, **React**, and **custom CSS/Tailwind CSS** by enabling modular course creation and navigation.

## 🎯 What It Does

This platform allows users to explore a deeply structured course layout, including:

```
Course → Modules → Blocks → Bits
```

Each **Bit** can be:

- 📖 Lesson  
- 🎬 Clip to Watch  
- 📄 Resource  
- 📝 Assessment  
- ❓ Quiz (currently fully functional)

It also includes:

- 🧑‍💼 A **Profile Section** for user information  
- 📊 An **Admin Dashboard** area for navigation and future controls
